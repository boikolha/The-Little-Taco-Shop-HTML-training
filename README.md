# "HTML Project for Beginners"

This project has been made to exercise with HTML coding. The webpages were created with the use of HTML and minimal of CSS.

1. I have created 3 files: index.html, hours.html and contact.html

2. In index.html file I have enclosed such information:
   -> About
   -> Menu
   -> have used links to menu and "back to top"

3. In hours.html file I have used:
   -> links to menu and "back to top"
   -> enclosed working hours

4. In contact.html file I have used:
   -> links to menu and "back to top"
   -> enclosed contact form with possibility to send text message
   -> location information with possibility to dial-up the phone number

- All images that are located in the img folder, the minimal CSS taht is listed in css/styles.css file and favicon were already created by author of the HTML course - @DaveGrayTeachesCode. Used screenshots of the examples to recreate the webpages index.html, hours.html and contact.html.

- Used taco emojis from [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/).
