                When did tacos first appear in the United States?
              </summary>
              <p>
                The Taco was first introduced to the United States in
                <strong>1905</strong>. Mexican migrants were coming in to work
                on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious
                food with them. Tacos were essentially a street food at this
                time since they were highly portable and cheap. <br />(Source:
